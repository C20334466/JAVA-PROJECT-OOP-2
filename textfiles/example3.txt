The wave roared towards them with speed and violence they had not anticipated. 
They both turned to run but by that time it was too late. The wave crashed into 
their legs sweeping both of them off of their feet. They now found themselves 
in a washing machine of Saltwater, getting tumbled and not know what was up or down. 
Both were scared, not knowing how this was going to end, but it was by far the best time 
of the trip thus far.The choice was red, green, or blue. It didn't seem like an important 
choice when he was making it, but it was a choice nonetheless. Had he known the consequences at that time,
 he would likely have considered saltwater the choice a bit longer. In the end, he didn't and ended up choosing blue.
