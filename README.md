# JAVA-PROJECT-OOP-2

Search Engine Project

This purpose of this Java project will be to create a tool that will check the contents of a group of text files and display the file that contians the searched term.

Essentially how it will work will be, the user insert a word or phrase into the GUI. The program goes through a set of text files and tries match the word/phrase. The text file with the strongest match will be returned to the top of the list

This tool will take things like Speeling errors ( see what i did there lol), Multiple words into consideration.
